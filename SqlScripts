--1) List all the columns and all the general information on each column from the table parking_violation 

select * from information_schema.columns
	where table_name = 'parking_violation'
	
--2) Count the number of null values in the vehicle_body_type and group by issuing agency. 
-- Replace null values with the value "Unknown" 


--Counting the number of null values
select issuing_agency, count(*) as NumNull 
	from parking_violation

--Check the updated values

--3) Identify the records where multiple tickets were issued for the same violation

with duplicate as (
select summons_number, plate_id,issue_date,violation_time,house_number,street_name,
	row_number() over(partition by plate_id,issue_date,violation_time,house_number,street_name order by summons_number) as duplicate
		from parking_violation
)

select * from duplicate 
	where duplicate>1

--4) The violation time is in string format, convert it into a time stamp and count the number 
	-- of violations by hour 

    -- Check the current format of the column violation_time
	select violation_time from parking_violation
	
    -- There is one invalid date "2450A", change it to "0050A"

	ALTER TABLE parking_violation
	ADD COLUMN violation_time_stamped TIME 
		
    -- The last letter of each cell in the violation_time column is an alphabet. 
    --Update the newly created violation_time_stamped column with a formula to remove the last character 
    -- and convert it to a time stamp  

	update parking_violation
	set violation_time_stamped = TO_TIMESTAMP(SUBSTR(violation_time,1,length(violation_time)-1),'HH24MI')::TIME



    -- Count the number of violations by hour
	select extract(hour from violation_time_stamped) as hour_violation, count(*)
		from parking_violation
			group by hour_violation
				order by hour_violation asc

--5) To answer the question of why violations occur, check the hypothesis that parking violations occur 
--as violators park just before the restrictions begin or end. What percentage of violations occured 
-- within one hour of parking violations begining or ending
	
	-- Check the current format of the column to_hours_in_effect
	select to_hours_in_effect from parking_violation
	
	-- There is one invalid date "30A", change it to "0300A"
		update parking_violation

	--Create a new column and name it to_hours_in_effect_stamped
	ALTER TABLE parking_violation
	ADD COLUMN to_hours_in_effect_stamped TIME
	
    -- The last letter of each cell in the to_hours_in_effect column is an alphabet.

-- CTE to extract the difference between the start time of the parking restrictions and the 
-- violation time in two columns in hours and minutes

		extract(minute from to_hours_in_effect_stamped - violation_time_stamped) as minutes

--Extract the violations that are booked within one hour of the restrictions coming into place, 
-- take a percentage of these violations on the total violations to check what % of the violations
-- occur close to the time of the restrictions coming into effect

	where hours = 0 and (minutes<=59 or minutes>=-59)

--6) Combine the house_number and street_name to create street_address, use the days_parking_in_effect
-- column to list whether parking restrictions exist for each day of the week for each street_address

-- Use CONCAT function to combine house number and street name. The days_parking_in_effect column has 
-- parking restrictions for each day of the week, use the REGEXP function to split to individual rows 
-- for each day of the week and the ROW_NUMBER window function to list the day number of each week 

select ROW_NUMBER() 
OVER(partition by street_address, violation_county order by street_address,violation_county) as day_number,*
from(
select CONCAT(house_number,' ',street_name) as street_address,violation_county,
	REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE(days_parking_in_effect,'') as daily_parking_violation
	from parking_violation) as subq

--7) Identify the top 4 agencies that issued the most number of tickets and use the FILTER function to
-- list the number of violations by each violation code for each of the 4 agencies in pivot format

-- Identify the top 4 agencies by counting and grouping by the issuing_agency

select issuing_agency,count(*) as Num_Violations
	from parking_violation
		group by issuing_agency
			order by Num_Violations desc
			
--Use the FILTER function to list in pivot format

select violation_code,
	COUNT(issuing_agency) FILTER(where issuing_agency = 'P') as "P",
	COUNT(issuing_agency) FILTER(where issuing_agency = 'X') as "X",
	COUNT(issuing_agency) FILTER(where issuing_agency = 'S') as "S",
	COUNT(issuing_agency) FILTER(where issuing_agency = 'K') as "K"
